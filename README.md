# MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA ANALYST PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my Machine Learning and Data Analyst Portfolio

I am a Machine Learning/Data Analyst engineer with 3 years experience working with various technologies to collect, organize, transform and analyze data.

I have 6 years experience as a Virtualization Systems Engineer in the United Arab Emiartes and Ireland and 3 years ago I decided to change career.

Machine Learning and Data Analystics are a real passion of mine, I have recently finsihed a Masters in AI, Cyber Security and Data Analytics. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau and I am Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Scientist.

In my portoflio, I will demonstrate my ability to work with various Machine Learning models working in Python and show my SQL skills to manage, organize and analyze data. I will show how I work from start to finish on Machine Learning models, showing my data analytics techniques and critical thinking, working with large and complex datasets.

I am looking for analytic thinking roles and I am confident the projects I will show in my portfolio will allow me to be considered for any Machine Learning and Data Anlyst roles you have available

Thank you for taking time to visit my portfolio and I look forward to hearing from you
