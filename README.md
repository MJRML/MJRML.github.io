# MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA ANALYST PORTFOLIO

Hello and Welcome to my portfolio

I am a Machine Learning and Data Analytics professional with three years of experience leveraging a variety of technologies to collect, organize, transform, and analyze data.

Prior to transitioning into this field, I spent six years as a Virtualization Systems Engineer in the United Arab Emirates and Ireland. Three years ago, I made a career shift to pursue my passion for Machine Learning and Data Analytics.

I have recently completed a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and Data Analytics, and I hold Microsoft Certification as an Azure Data Scientist. I am proficient in Python, SQL, and Tableau, and I specialize in developing machine learning models and deriving insights from data.

Within this portfolio, I will showcase my ability to work with various machine learning models in Python, as well as my expertise in SQL to manage, organize, and analyze complex datasets. I will walk you through my approach to end-to-end machine learning projects, highlighting my data analysis techniques and problem-solving skills.

I am currently seeking opportunities that require strong analytical thinking, and I am confident that the projects featured in my portfolio will demonstrate my qualifications for roles in Machine Learning and Data Analytics.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to the opportunity to connect with you.
